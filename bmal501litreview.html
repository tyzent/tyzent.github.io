Review: Effective Teams in the Workplace</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There has been a significant transformation in the last four decades
from work organized around individual jobs to team-based work structures
(Andrejczuk et al., 2018). Modern organizational teams face significant
challenges succeeding in highly competitive climates with ever-changing
challenges. Modern day organizations are more diverse, dynamic, and
geographically disconnected than at any point in history. Team leaders
must always be striving to improve overall culture, composition, and
productivity of their teams while maintaining awareness of individual
employee wellbeing. Building effective teams in the workplace is
critical to organizational success. Outcomes can be affected by easily
measurable one-time decisions, while others require a less tangible and
delicate balance. Individual team members can be demotivated by problems
with colleagues, a perceived lack of leadership integrity, and
ineffective organizational structures. The primary purpose of a leader
is to remove roadblocks for effective team success. The leadership
style, personality traits, and structures of leaders and leadership
teams are critical to creating effective workplace teams. Integral to
efficient structure is the type of team and both how they work within
the business, and how they work with each other. Positive working
environments and workplace resilience are correlated and necessary to
create highly effective teams.</p>
<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<p>Teamwork is the process of working collectively in a group to achieve
a desired goal. One element of teamwork is how a team fits within the
larger organization, and another is how that team functions and works
together. Teamwork brings people together and motivates them to rely on
each other to achieve a goal. Effective teamwork makes progress easier,
and allows the group to overcome obstacles that might have stymied an
individual. A critical element of teamwork is communication, both within
the team itself, and how the team communicates with the larger
organization.</p>
<p>Team structure refers to the composition of an individual team and
how they connect to outside elements. The structure defines how a
company’s activities will meet its goals. Effective teams are important
to organizational competitiveness, with especially critical elements
such as team composition, team formation, and their relationship with
overall performance. It is crucial to have heterogeneous team members to
maximize team performance heterogeneous team (Andrejczuk et al., 2018).
A heterogeneous team is composed of diverse individuals in terms of
their abilities and experiences.</p>
<p>The primary way for teams to work together is with consistent
meetings. At their best these get-togethers can be a good way for all
members of a team to be on the same page and make sure they are working
collaboratively, and at their worst they can be frustrating and
unhelpful. Workplace meetings are a topic of significant popular debate,
especially with the need for flexibility in light of the COVID-19
pandemic. Effective communication and collaboration are critical to team
effectiveness, and can have significant positive and negative impacts on
an organization. There is a need to further explore the topic, with a
focus on meetings as rituals wherein groups and organizations form
cultures, identities, and climates (Mroz et al., 2018).</p>
<p>At its core a team is a shared commitment, and strives for something
greater than the sum of individual abilities. When teams are working
together at their critical effectiveness, they are able to enter a team
flow state. Team flow is a state of mind in which a group becomes fully
immersed in a collective activity. Work produced during a flow state
tends to be of higher quality and more creative than work produced
outside of these periods of deep work. Benefits of high engagement
include a strong connection to the team and organization, and a better
team performance. A team is more likely to enter a flow state when
everyone sees a challenge or opportunity for action that meets the top
of their collective skill level, and therefore promotes deep engagement
(van den Hout et al., 2018).</p>
<h2 id="team-composition">Team Composition</h2>
<p>Team composition refers to the overall mix of characteristics of
people in a team, with an emphasis on the leader. Key factors include
leadership styles and personality traits. A well-composed team has
individuals with complementary knowledge and skills as well as
leadership style and personality traits that are not only compatible,
but elevate the overall potential for success. Deep-level composition
variables like personality traits and leadership styles tend to have a
stronger and longer lasting influence on teamwork and performance than
surface-level variables like demographics.</p>
<p>Leadership is a major factor in the growth, effectiveness, and
success of organizations. Effective leaders are able to adapt their
leadership styles depending on their understanding of the organizational
situation. House’s path-goal theory suggests that the effectiveness of
leadership behavior is contingent on organizational context. The
leader’s ability to clarify goals and motivate employees depend on how
well they reduce role ambiguity and provide adequate rewards, and a
leader’s ability to motivate their team involves clarifying the path,
reducing roadblocks and pitfalls, and facilitating personal
satisfaction. Leaders are effective when they are able to clarify
linkages between effort and goal attainment, and provide necessary
resources and support for achieving work goals. Successful teams develop
the leadership skills of each member so that they can proactively
address change. Under a shared leadership model, all members should be
held accountable for team performance and be encouraged to communicate
concerns to the team (Satterlee, 2019). House stressed the importance of
shared leadership, and his theory indicates that leaders can adapt their
behavior to meet the specific needs of the organization. Shared
transformational leadership has a critical role in the safety behaviors
of team members (Lyubykh et al., 2022). Team members working under a
shared transformational leadership model are more likely to comply with
safety regulations.</p>
<p>The key factors of an effective workplace teams are skill, experience
and personality. While business often consider skills and expertise,
taking personality traits into account can be a determining factor in
the team’s success. The five major personality traits are openness,
conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Some
industry leaders suggest that complimentary traits within a team are
helpful, but that too much diversity in personality can be a negative
factor in team effectiveness, as it can lead to a lack of understanding
and empathy. There is significant scholarly research regarding
extroversion as a personality trait among leaders, and limited
assessments of positive elements of introverted leaders. Extraverted
leaders may be poor team contributors (Blevins et al., 2021). More
research should be conducted on introversion, to better understand how
introverts can continue to add value within their workplace teams.
Introversion and extroversion are important traits to consider when
discussing effective teams in the workplace, and the positive
characteristics of each in a team environment.</p>
<h2 id="team-culture">Team Culture</h2>
<p>Team culture is influenced by and built through the work environment,
and impacts the ability of a team to band together for a common purpose
and remain flexible when facing adversity. Team culture is a combination
of values, beliefs, and behaviors that members share and the outcomes
resulting from the factors. A strong team culture promotes loyalty and
engagement in members and attracts talented outside individuals.</p>
<p>One goal of an effective workplace team is to create a positive
working environment with a person-centered culture. Modern competitive
organizations are shifting away from negative outcomes and focusing on
creating conditions that promote a positive environment characteristic
of flourishing human condition (Geue, 2018). These companies endeavor to
develop a climate that promotes employee well-being.</p>
<p>Person-centered workplace cultures and effective teamwork have been
linked to organizations achieving optimal outcomes (Masimula et al.,
2021). A person-centered workplace is a respectful, safe, and engaging
environment for employees. This type of culture would be a shift for
some businesses that are production or profit focused. Employers should
put their employees first, not customers, profit, or production.</p>
<p>Workplace team resilience is the ability of a team to respond to
change and disruption in a flexible and innovative manner. Employees
often face high pressure in their work environments, and adverse events
are inevitable when working with people. Workplace resilience is a
potential key factor in maintaining effective performance on both a team
and individual level. A group composed of resilient individuals may not
necessarily form a resilient team (Hartwig et al., 2020). There is a
relationship between the two but there are other determining factors
like culture, composition, and leadership. Resilient teams are able to
band together to achieve organizational success, but the system and
culture are as important as the team composition (Hibbert et al.,
2018).</p>
<h2 id="successful-outcomes">Successful Outcomes</h2>
<p>The goal of any team is to achieve a set goal, and there are various
measures to qualify success. Diverse perspectives and thought processes
can be critical to team innovation. Difference-driven inquiry is the
process of deliberation that aims to voice difference and emplace
healthy conflict, as opposed to ideational tools that might not be
effective without high team cohesion. A team’s ability to innovate has
less to do with the composition of a team that the structures of the
team’s operations (Moreau, 2020). Regular review of a group’s
performance through team meetings and one-on-one performance appraisals
will ensure that progress is being made. After the outcomes are
adequately understood thoroughly, it is important for leaders to
regularly recognize, reward, and celebrate team and individual
performance.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is critical for a leader to understand, evaluate, and measure the
effectiveness of workplace teams. Key factors include the composition,
structures, and measurable outcomes. Each member of the team can bring a
unique perspective and a complimentary set of personality traits and
leadership styles. Communication is critical to overall team
effectiveness, both within the team and with the larger organizational
structure. An effective workplace team is built of goal-focused
individuals with specialized expertise and complementary skills who
collaborate, innovate, and produce consistently superior results. They
relentlessly pursue excellent performance through shared goals, shared
leadership, collaboration, open communication, and clear expectations. A
leader looking to build an effective workplace team should focus on
building trust, working with integrity, and encourage healthy
organizational conflict. Effective teamwork requires openness, trust,
and respect among colleagues.</p>
